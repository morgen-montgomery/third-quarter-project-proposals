## Project Description
  Scavenger Hunt App that utilizes geofencing to create organized and customizable experiences for friends and family.

## Who uses it?
  Target Demographic

  - (initial) 21+ crowd that wants to organize bar crawl with friends.
  - (initial) The family that wants to create a fun outing exploring landmarks, parks, and places of interest within a city.
  - (future)  Organized groups like the AlleyCats that hold competitive events around the city.

## What outputs do they need?
a. OAuth - IF user (validate on backend), send to 'make a Scavenger Hunt' screen,
              ELSE make user resubmit or sign up.

b. Invite generated via email / text

c. Upon receiving SH invitation  - IF accept, send to OAuth?
                                      ELSE, generate 'maybe next time' message

### Once Scavenger Hunt becomes accessible:
- Interactive drop-down menu for each clue/riddle generates, utilizing inputs from (b)

d. onClick 'I think I'm here' button  -  IF at right location  - turn clue a different color,

### Once all clues/riddles solved, final destination unlocked.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
a. OAuth

b. Form
- Name your Scavenger Hunt
- Date | Time | Location that Scavenger Hunt commences
- Addresses of locations for Scavenger Hunt (tied to geofencing)
- Clues/riddles to locations
- Invite friends (via email / text)
- Specify Team Captains

c. Accept or reject invitation

d. 'I think I'm here' button

#### ** POINT SYSTEM:
- max points given for each location (set by organizer)
- deduct points for using optional (additional) hints accessible during SH (set by organizer)
- when 'I think I'm here' successful, recalibrate score

## What technologies will you use that weren't covered in class?
* Geofencing (w/ geolocation radius)
* React (2nd)
* React Native (1st)
* Mapbox

## What technologies do you plan to use?
* Node.js
* Express
* Several APIs
* FB OAuth

## Feature list (Nice-to-haves)
* Instagram tagging (API, geolocation)
* Partnering with businesses and retailers for cross promotion (possibly Groupon API)(potentially a great way to partner with locally owned businesses)
* Splitwise
* Venmo
* 'Progress Board' to compare your progress to other teams
* Geolocation toggling- option for user to set up visible geolocation radius, or keep it behind the scenes (ie competition vs general outing)
* On successful OAuth login, option to access past scavenger hunt, but main focus goes to creating a new one.
* Display page generated upon completion of scavenger hunt
* Auth for initial user VS team captain VS teammate
* Upon submission addresses of locations, auto-generate dropped pins via Mapbox on 'create a SH' page to help organizing user visualize scope of hunt
* Organizer has option to 'Start' Scavenger Hunt at will OR SH becomes accessible on Team Captain's phones at pre disclosed Date and Time
* Countdown feature
* See past scavenger hunts
* Points of interest / trivia about a novelty product found at, or history of, location
* Team delegation more customizable
* Toggle between map and clues during SH
